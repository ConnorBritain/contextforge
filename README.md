 ### Database Strategy
 
-ContextForge uses a hybrid database approach:
+ContextForge uses Firebase for both authentication and data storage:
 
-#### MongoDB (Primary Database)
-- Stores document data, user profiles, and usage analytics
-- Handles persistent data storage on the server
-- Used for complex queries and data aggregation
-- Required in production mode
-
-#### Firebase (Authentication & Client-side)
+#### Firebase (Authentication & Firestore Database)
 - Handles user authentication including Google OAuth
-- Provides real-time capabilities for collaborative features
-- Offers client-side storage options
+- Uses **Firestore** as the primary database to store document data, user profiles, and usage analytics.
+- Handles persistent data storage directly within the Firebase ecosystem.
+- Provides real-time capabilities for potential future collaborative features.
 - Simplifies mobile/web authentication flow
 
 #### Advantages of this approach:
 - **Separation of concerns**: Authentication is handled by Firebase's battle-tested system.
-- **Flexibility**: Development can proceed without full database setup
-- **Transition path**: Allows gradual migration between database systems
-- **Performance**: Uses each database for its strengths
-- **Development simplicity**: Mock services can replace both in development
-
-#### Configuration:
-- Enable/disable MongoDB with `MONGODB_REQUIRED=true` in environment
-- Firebase is optional in development but recommended for auth in production
-- Mock services provide fallbacks when databases are unavailable
+- **Integrated Ecosystem**: Leverages Firebase's seamless integration between Auth, Firestore, and other services.
+- **Scalability**: Firestore offers automatic scaling.
+- **Real-time Updates**: Built-in support for real-time data synchronization.
+- **Development Simplicity**: Firebase Emulator Suite allows for local development, and mock services can provide fallbacks if needed.
